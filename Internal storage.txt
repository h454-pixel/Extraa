   File
      An "abstract" representation of a file system entity identified by a
      pathname. The pathname may be absolute (relative to the root directory
     of the file system) or relative to the current directory in which
      the program is running.

    The actual file referenced by a File may or may not exist. It may also,
   despite the name File, be a directory or other non-regular file.

**********A directory is a File which can contain a list of other files and directories. 
You use File object to create directories, 
to list down files available in a directory. 
For complete detail, check a list of all the methods which you can call 
on File object and what are related to directories.

    String dirname = "/tmp/user/java/bin";
      File d = new File(dirname);

Once you know this fundamental difference betwee
stream and reader, understanding difference between 

FileInputStream and FileReader is quite easy. 
Both allows you to read data from File, 
but FileInputStream is used to read binary data, while FileReader is used to read character data.
